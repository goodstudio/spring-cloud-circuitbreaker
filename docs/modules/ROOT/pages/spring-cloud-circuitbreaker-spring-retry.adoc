= Configuring Spring Retry Circuit Breakers
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Retry provides declarative retry support for Spring applications.
A subset of the project includes the ability to implement circuit breaker functionality.
Spring Retry provides a circuit breaker implementation via a combination of it's
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/retry/policy/CircuitBreakerRetryPolicy.java[`CircuitBreakerRetryPolicy`]
and a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry#stateful-retry[stateful retry].
All circuit breakers created using Spring Retry will be created using the `CircuitBreakerRetryPolicy` and a
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/retry/support/DefaultRetryState.java[`DefaultRetryState`].
Both of these classes can be configured using `SpringRetryConfigBuilder`.
